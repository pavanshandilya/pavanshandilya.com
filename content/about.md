This is a shared home for **Pavan** and **Pooja**.

{{< social-kit >}}

## What this site does

1. Publishes blog posts and practical notes.
2. Shows two independent live-role dashboards (one per person).
3. Keeps everything in one clean Hugo repo with boring, reliable automation.

## How we use it

- **Pavan** and **Pooja** each have their own role profile and source registry.
- Content sections are shared and common.
- CI updates live roles daily and deploys the site.

For day-to-day operations, open the **Playbook** page from the top menu.
