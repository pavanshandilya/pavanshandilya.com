        and hands-onSenior Product Managerto join our product team and help
        drive success of the matching experience within our platform. Aroundhome
        is a two-sided marketplace platform where the possibility of shared
        success begins with the match: the moment a homeowner is connected with
        the right partner. The Matching Experience domain owns this critical
        step of the marketplace journey: making you responsible for transforming
        house owner service requests into high-quality partner matches that lead
        to successful projects and long-term platform engagement. In achieving
        this, aspects of quality and retention are as much part of your
        responsibility as is maximizing business outcome. At Aroundhome, Product
        Managers play a pivotal role in shaping the success of Germany’s leading
        housing project platform. We work in a domain-based model, where each
        product team owns a clearly defined part of the platform. This structure
        fosters close collaboration within cross-functional teams and ensures
        that the expertise needed for continuous product discovery, hypothesis
        development, and iterative improvement sits directly within each domain.
        As a Senior Product Manager, you play a critical role in driving and
        executing the strategy, setting a clear direction, and ensuring that
        your domain delivers meaningful value to both customer groups -
        homeowners and partners - as well as to the business. You continuously
        shape domain strategy and vision, setting clear measurable goals and
        roadmap for the matching experience to improve conversion through
        personal data collection and validation funnels, as well as increase
        match quality, trust, and successful project outcomes. You also actively
        rally those around you toward this vision. You drive domain growth
        through continuous end-to-end product discovery, using quantitative and
        qualitative insights to identify opportunities, devise solutions and
        make evidence-based, outcome-driven decisions with measurable impact.
        You communicate with clarity and purpose, translate complex topics into
        compelling narratives, and foster strong collaboration across Product,
        Tech, Product Analytics, UX, Marketing, Customer Care, Sales, and
        cross-domain stakeholders to enable decision-making and inspire action
        to develop impactful solutions. You are also comfortable managing up and
        aligning directly with C and Director level stakeholders. You ensure a
        strong balance between long-term strategic goals and short-term
        trade-offs, driving continuous (lean) delivery through effective backlog
        management and close collaboration with Engineering and Design to
        consistently deliver high-quality, incremental value. Skills You are
        experienced in optimizing complex user funnels and decision-driven
        experiences (e.g. personal data validation, recommendations, matching),
        using experimentation and data to improve conversion, quality, and user
        trust while laying the foundation for long-term platform engagement. You
        apply strong analytical thinking and product analytics skills to define
        meaningful success measures, interpret data, uncover insights, and guide
        evidence-based decisions across product opportunities to drive
        measurable user and business outcomes. You bring order to chaos by
        aligning diverse stakeholder perspectives and fostering a shared
        understanding across teams through your excellent communication skills
        in English, a structured way of working, and your entrepreneurial
        mindset. You proactively apply AI to enhance both product experiences
        and internal productivity, using hands-on experience with AI tools to
        drive efficiency and user-centric innovation. As a team player with a

        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between

        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate

        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands

        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative

      description: "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance
        optimization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define
        and execute the long-term vision&lt;/strong&gt; for the Creative Tech
        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate
        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative
        teams.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &quot;guardian of
        data,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; treating creative metadata as a strategic
        asset to enable future Brand Marketing Mix Modeling and granular
        performance analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong
        collaborator&lt;/strong&gt; who can build trust with diverse
        stakeholders—from Creative Directors and Brand Strategists to Data
        Engineers and Performance Marketers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilient and solution-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;,
        comfortable operating with a &quot;start-up mentality&quot; within a
        larger organization, focused on rapid learning and impact.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive product management
        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform
        environments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with GenAI /
        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept
        from an ambiguous problem statement to a scaled solution with measurable
        business impact.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong analytical
        skills&lt;/strong&gt;, with the ability to define and optimize complex
        metric trees involving efficiency (throughput, lead time) and
        effectiveness (conversion rates, brand consistency).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
        capable of influencing senior stakeholders (VP+) and articulating a
        compelling product vision that aligns technical and commercial
        goals.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in &quot;Platform
        Product Management&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or building internal tools that
        serve multiple downstream user groups is a plus.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

      description: "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance
        optimization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define
        and execute the long-term vision&lt;/strong&gt; for the Creative Tech
        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate
        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative
        teams.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &quot;guardian of
        data,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; treating creative metadata as a strategic
        asset to enable future Brand Marketing Mix Modeling and granular
        performance analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong
        collaborator&lt;/strong&gt; who can build trust with diverse
        stakeholders—from Creative Directors and Brand Strategists to Data
        Engineers and Performance Marketers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilient and solution-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;,
        comfortable operating with a &quot;start-up mentality&quot; within a
        larger organization, focused on rapid learning and impact.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive product management
        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform
        environments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with GenAI /
        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept
        from an ambiguous problem statement to a scaled solution with measurable
        business impact.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong analytical
        skills&lt;/strong&gt;, with the ability to define and optimize complex
        metric trees involving efficiency (throughput, lead time) and
        effectiveness (conversion rates, brand consistency).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
        capable of influencing senior stakeholders (VP+) and articulating a
        compelling product vision that aligns technical and commercial
        goals.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in &quot;Platform
        Product Management&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or building internal tools that

      description: "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance
        optimization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define
        and execute the long-term vision&lt;/strong&gt; for the Creative Tech
        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate
        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative
        teams.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &quot;guardian of
        data,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; treating creative metadata as a strategic
        asset to enable future Brand Marketing Mix Modeling and granular
        performance analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong
        collaborator&lt;/strong&gt; who can build trust with diverse
        stakeholders—from Creative Directors and Brand Strategists to Data
        Engineers and Performance Marketers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilient and solution-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;,
        comfortable operating with a &quot;start-up mentality&quot; within a
        larger organization, focused on rapid learning and impact.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;

        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform
        environments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with GenAI /
        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept
        from an ambiguous problem statement to a scaled solution with measurable
        business impact.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong analytical
        skills&lt;/strong&gt;, with the ability to define and optimize complex
        metric trees involving efficiency (throughput, lead time) and
        effectiveness (conversion rates, brand consistency).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
        capable of influencing senior stakeholders (VP+) and articulating a
        compelling product vision that aligns technical and commercial

      description: "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance
        optimization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll
        do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define
        and execute the long-term vision&lt;/strong&gt; for the Creative Tech
        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
        strategic thinker&lt;/strong&gt; capable of working on ambiguous
        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate
        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative
        teams.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &quot;guardian of
        data,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; treating creative metadata as a strategic
        asset to enable future Brand Marketing Mix Modeling and granular
        performance analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong
        collaborator&lt;/strong&gt; who can build trust with diverse
        stakeholders—from Creative Directors and Brand Strategists to Data
        Engineers and Performance Marketers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilient and solution-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;,

        larger organization, focused on rapid learning and impact.&lt;/li&gt;

        bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive product management
        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform
        environments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with GenAI /
        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept
        from an ambiguous problem statement to a scaled solution with measurable
        business impact.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong analytical
        skills&lt;/strong&gt;, with the ability to define and optimize complex
        metric trees involving efficiency (throughput, lead time) and
        effectiveness (conversion rates, brand consistency).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
        capable of influencing senior stakeholders (VP+) and articulating a

        Product Management&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or building internal tools that

        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance
        optimization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll

        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting
        directly on metrics like &quot;Time to Market&quot; and &quot;Creative
        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A

        opportunity domains without a clear overarching solution, independently
        defining strategies that span multiple squads or alliances.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; who understands
        the potential of Generative AI in the creative space and can translate
        technical possibilities into tangible product value for creative
        teams.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &quot;guardian of

        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform
        environments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with GenAI /
        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept

        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between

        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks

        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply rigorous product management best
        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting

        Performance&quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You

        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability

        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a

        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback

        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a

        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this

        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback

        &lt;p&gt;We are hiring a &lt;strong&gt;Staff Product
        Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to define and lead the vision for our newly
        formed &lt;strong&gt;Creative Tech&lt;/strong&gt; squad. This team is a
        critical enabler of HelloFresh’s 2026 &quot;The Refresh&quot; strategy,
        tasked with building the technical foundation to help further brand
        excitement and achieve product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this
        role, you will move beyond simple asset generation to build a holistic,
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-native content engine&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the
        entire marketing workflow including building feedback loops for
        continuous improvements. You will lead the shift from a fragmented,
        manual content process to one that is efficient, data-driven, and end to
        end integrated. This is a strategic role with high ambiguity and high
        visibility, offering the opportunity to demonstrate how
        &lt;strong&gt;AI-first teams&lt;/strong&gt; can ship faster and with
        higher quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will act as a bridge between
        creativity and technology, empowering our Brand, Creative, Product and
        Marketing teams to focus on high-impact strategic work while your
        platform handles the scale, consistency, and performance

        platform, moving us toward &quot;end-to-end automation&quot; of campaign
        creation—from brief to final asset deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the discovery and delivery&lt;/strong&gt;
        of high-impact opportunities in a highly ambiguous domain, such as
        building a &quot;Creative Performance Intelligence Engine&quot; to link
        creative components to business value, or an &quot;AI-Generated
        Video&quot; solution for recipe steps.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback
        system&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that performance data feeds back into
        the creative process to enable data-backed briefs and measurable
        improvements in marketing ROI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve
        complex operational bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; by leveraging GenAI to
        reduce lead times for tasks like translation and localization from weeks
        to hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a single-threaded
        leader&lt;/strong&gt; across Tribes and Alliances, driving alignment
        between Brand Strategy, Creative Studio, and downstream product teams
        (Adtech, CRM, Landing Pages, Conversion funnel).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion an AI-first mindset&lt;/strong&gt;,
        creating a &quot;playground&quot; for rapid experimentation to validate
        hypotheses around automated content generation, brand voice
        codification, and visual identity management.&lt;/li&gt;

        practices&lt;/strong&gt; to prioritize a roadmap that balances immediate
        efficiency wins with long-term strategic capabilities, reporting

        experience&lt;/strong&gt;, with a proven track record of working as a
        Senior or Staff PM in complex data, MarTech, or content platform

        LLM applications&lt;/strong&gt; or Creative Tech tools (e.g., DAMs like
        Bynder, Dynamic Creative Optimization, or automated content generation)
        is highly desirable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven ability
        to lead &quot;0-to-1&quot; products&lt;/strong&gt;, taking a concept

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
        capable of influencing senior stakeholders (VP+) and articulating a
